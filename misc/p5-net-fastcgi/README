NAME
    Net::FastCGI - FastCGI Toolkit

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution aims to provide a complete API for working with the
    FastCGI protocol.

    The primary goal is to provide a function oriented and object oriented
    API which are not tied to a specific I/O model or framework.

    Secondary goal is to provide higher level tools/API which can be used
    for debugging and interoperability testing.

PROGRESS
    The function oriented API is considered feature complete.
    Net::FastCGI::Protocol provides functions to build and parse all FastCGI
    v1.0 messages, also provided is a few convenient higher level functions
    such as "build_begin_request()", "build_end_request()", "parse_record()"
    and "dump_record()".

    Work has begun on object oriented implementation and a simple blocking
    I/O class which is intended for testing and debugging.

PACKAGES
    Net::FastCGI::Constant
        FastCGI protocol constants.

    Net::FastCGI::IO
        Provides functions to read and write FastCGI messages.

    Net::FastCGI::Protocol
        Provides functions to build and parse FastCGI messages.

ENVIRONMENT
    Environment variable "NET_FASTCGI_PP" can be set to a true value before
    loading this package to disable usage of XS implementation.
